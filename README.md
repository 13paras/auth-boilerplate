# Authentication Boilerplate with MERN and PERN Stacks

This repository contains boilerplate code for creating a full-stack web application with authentication using both MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and PERN (PostgreSQL, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stacks. The code is available in  TypeScript as of now but later javascript code will also be added.

## Features

- üë§ User registration and login
- #Ô∏è‚É£ Secure password hashing
- ü™ô JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication
- üç™ Setting Cookies
- üîí Middleware for route protection
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Error handling
